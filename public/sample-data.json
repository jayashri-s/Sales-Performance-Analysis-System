    "voiceNoteTranscript": "Hello, this is Ishita Naidu from LMES. I spoke with Tara Sharma regarding our LMES LMS offering and walked them through the key value propositions. I explained features like SCORM / xAPI support, customizable course paths, and role-based access control and how these solve common administrative pain points for schools and training centers. The customer raised concerns about onboarding time, and I reassured them by describing our flexible pricing plans, free migration assistance, and a dedicated onboarding specialist. We discussed expected timelines and delivered a tentative plan: pilot within two weeks, followed by scaled rollout after user testing. Outcome noted: Interested. Next step: await payment link."
